# Machine Learning Roadmap

## Goal
Develop and increase understanding surrounding Machine learning models, specifically with regards to theory and the math surrounding the models

## Model Roadmap

| Model Type        | Model             | 
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | 
| Regression        | Linear Regression             | 
| Classification    | Logistic Regression           | 
| Lazy Learning     | KNN                           | 
| Tree-based        | Decision Tree → Random Forest | 
| Probabilistic     | Naive Bayes                   | 
| Margin-based      | SVM                           | 
| Ensemble Learning | Gradient Boosting / XGBoost   |
