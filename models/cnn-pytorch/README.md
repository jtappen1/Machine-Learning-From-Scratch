# Convolutional Neural Network - PyTorch

## Goal:
    Goal for this project is to create a simple convolutional neural network using PyTorch to practice simple PyTorch commands and familiarize myself with CNN architecture

## Model:
    This is a very simple CNN, uses two blocks of 2 conv layers followed by a max pool, then 2 FC layers.  It is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Learning Outcomes:
    - Improved understanding of CNN Architecture particularly the layers
        - Convolution Layer
        - Max Pooling Layer
        - FC Layer
